Dynamic Snake Growth: The snake grows longer each time it consumes food.

Randomized Food Placement: Food appears at random locations on the grid, providing a dynamic and challenging experience.

Control the Snake: Use arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to navigate the snake on the grid.

Collect Food: Move the snake to the food to collect it and grow longer.

Avoid Collisions: Be cautious not to collide with the walls or the snake's own body.

Score Points: Accumulate points by successfully collecting food. The longer the snake, the higher your score.
